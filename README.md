## ‚ú®Overview

The *search* module is a Python framework designed to solve search problems using classic algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

This module is especially useful for tasks involving state-space search, such as path finding, game solving, or any scenario that requires systematic exploration of states.

It demonstrates step-by-step algorithm execution and logs internal data structures for educational purposes.

## üì• Installation
No installation is required; simply add *search.py* to your project folder and import the necessary classes:

```python
from search import SearchProblem, Node
```

## üöÄ Basic usage

The module provides two core abstract classes, *SearchProblem* and *Node*, to  be extended to implement custom search solutions. You have to create problem-specific classes by inheriting from *SearchProblem* and *Node*.

In this basic usage example, the classes *Maze* and *MazeNode* handle maze-related logic in a maze solving script:

```python
class Maze(SearchProblem):
   # ...

class MazeNode(Node):
   # ...
```

Implement the required abstract methods in your subclasses to define your specific problem environment (refer to the documentation for more details).

```python
class Maze(SearchProblem):
   def __init__():
      # Maze specific implementation here

   def show_solution():
      # Maze specific implementation here

class MazeNode(Node)
   def __init__():
      # Maze specific implementation here

   def actions():
      # Maze specific implementation here

   def result():
      # Maze specific implementation here
```

Instantiate a Maze object:

```python
maze = Maze()
```

Solve the search problem using BFS or DFS:

```python
maze.solve('BFS')
```

Print the discovered solution:

```python
maze.show_solution('BFS')
```

Obtain a detailed log of algorithmic steps:

```python
maze.save_algorithm_steps_to_file()
```

## üí° Key Features

### Object-Oriented Design

  The module follows OOP principles, encapsulating problem-solving elements into classes. Each class is responsible for specific functionality, ensuring modularity and reusability.

### Abstract Classes

* Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

  Interface classes are defined as abstract using Python‚Äôs ABC module. This forces any concrete subclass to implement critical methods.

* Protected Methods and Attributes

  Methods and attributes prefixed with an underscore (_) are intended for internal use, keeping users focused on essential interfaces and abstracting lower-level details.

* Explicit Subclassing Requirements

  Marking methods as abstract in interface classes ensures subclasses provide the necessary implementations, promoting a controlled interface tailored to each search scenario.

### Modularity and Extensibility

* Pluggable Search Algorithms

  Different search strategies (BFS, DFS) are supported by selecting the type of frontier (stack, queue). This design simplifies adding or modifying search algorithms without changing the overall structure.

* Audit Trail and Algorithm Steps Log

  Dedicated class captures each step of the search process, including frontier and explored-node states. This comprehensive record aids in debugging and provides transparent insight into how the search progresses.

### Customizable Output

  Method that prints solution can be used directly or overridden in subclasses to customize the solution's presentation format, allowing for flexible output that meets domain-specific or user-defined requirements.
