## üôè Credits

This project is a based on the code from [HarvardX:CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python).

The original code was designed to focus on algorithm implementation for an AI course, offering simplicity as its primary goal. Redesigning it to incorporate additional features and enhanced modularity was a challenging and rewarding task.

I have re-designed the original code to align with the :doc:features, ensuring greater flexibility and extensibility.
